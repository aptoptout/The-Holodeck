# THE HOLODECK
## Laboratory of creative coding experiments

Check out the repository of this laboratory â€” note that the experiments are specifically focused on P5js.
All the experiments are [here] https://github.com/martijndeheer/The-Holodeck/tree/gh-pages/js

Experiments to conduct:
* Make a friendly environment with some basic navigational elements.
* Movement through 3D space by keys and mouse.
* Automated algorithmic landscape generation.
* Including DOM elements as part of design.
* Translate several sketches from processing to P5js with added interactivity.
* Having a 3D space that divides itself according to a specific algorithm
* Navigating through an OBJ file (H6)
* Drawing a navigational mountain like landscape (H6)
