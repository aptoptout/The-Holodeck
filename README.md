# THE HOLODECK
## Laboratory of creative coding experiments

Check out the repository of this laboratory â€” note that the experiments are specifically focused on P5js.
All the experiments are [here] https://github.com/martijndeheer/The-Holodeck/tree/gh-pages/js

### Experiments to conduct:
- [x] Make a friendly environment with some basic navigational elements.
- [x] Being able to switch or navigate through multiple experiments.
- [x] Experiment with vectors and forces that react (attract and reflect) to mouse.
- [ ] Mapping data (tweets?) to an 3D object by itterating through am array containing its points (CSV?).
- [ ] Movement through 3D space by keys and mouse.
- [ ] Automated algorithmic landscape generation.
- [ ] Including DOM elements as part of design (asin a HUD).
- [ ] Translate several sketches from processing to P5js with added interactivity.
- [ ] Having a 3D space that divides itself according to a specific algorithm
- [ ] Navigating through an OBJ file [H6 of Symbiotic Spark's COMPOSITION 01]
- [ ] Drawing a navigational mountain like landscape [H6 of Symbiotic Spark's COMPOSITION 01]
- [ ] Adding loading states when an 'end' of an experiment is reached and therefor loading the next experiment (chaining the experiments according to queries and borders).
